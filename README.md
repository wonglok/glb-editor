In a multiverse (multiple metaverse) setting, it's important for GLB 3D model files to have portable VFX attached to it.

1. Cross Multiverse / metaverse Fashion with VFX
2. Cross multiverse Avatars with VFX
3. build up more lower level simulation modules such as particle simulation and line simulation and etc so that artists can create different visuals 
4. Setup a big community of VFX developers code share.

## Multiverse 3D Web Technology Powered By Effect Node

User can wear their VFX virtual shoes / virtual fashion across the metaverse which uses the same open sourced engine that are free for commercial use with a standard open source MIT License.

User can add more features of VFX to their engine and share the code easily with their friends.

## GLB + Effect Node = Interotability Oriented 3D Engine for multiple metaverses - Multiverse

GLB has alawys been a good standard for the 3D content on the internet. It also supports embeding JSON user data within the 3d Model. With Effect Node, different logic system json can be embended into the 3d mdoel. So that each part of the 3d model can be decorated with different visual effects.
